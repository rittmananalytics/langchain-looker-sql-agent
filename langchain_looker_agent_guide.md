# Introduction

`langchain-looker-agent` is a powerful tool that bridges the gap between natural language processing and business intelligence. It allows you to interact with your Looker instance using natural language queries, making data exploration and analysis more intuitive and accessible.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of `langchain-looker-agent`, covering installation, configuration, different querying methods, and best practices to help you get started and use the agent effectively.

**Benefits:**

*   **Query Looker with Natural Language:** Ask questions about your data in plain English and receive answers directly from Looker.
*   **Integrate Looker Data into Langchain Workflows:** Seamlessly incorporate Looker data into your existing Langchain pipelines, enabling more complex data processing and AI-driven insights.
*   **Democratize Data Access:** Empower non-technical users to explore data and gain insights without needing to learn Looker's specific query language (LookML) or SQL.

**Querying Methods:**

`langchain-looker-agent` offers two primary ways to query your Looker instance:

1.  **Direct Semantic Layer Access:** This method leverages Looker's semantic layer, allowing you to query data using Looker's pre-defined dimensions and measures. This is ideal for users who are familiar with Looker's data model and want to perform targeted queries.
2.  **SQL Agent:** This method utilizes a SQL agent that translates natural language queries into SQL, which is then executed against your Looker-connected database. This approach provides greater flexibility for complex queries and for users who are more comfortable with SQL.

# Installation

This section guides you through installing the `langchain-looker-agent` and its prerequisites.

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Python:** Python 3.8 or higher is recommended.
*   **Looker API Credentials:** You will need API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) from your Looker instance to allow the agent to authenticate and access data. Ensure the user associated with these credentials has the necessary permissions to query the desired data.
*   **Pip:** The Python package installer.

**Installation Steps:**

1.  **Install the package:**

    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install langchain-looker-agent
    ```

    This command will download and install the latest version of `langchain-looker-agent` and its dependencies.

# Configuration and Authentication

After installing the `langchain-looker-agent`, you need to configure it to connect to your Looker instance. This involves providing your Looker API endpoint and authentication credentials.

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   **Looker API Endpoint (Base URL):** This is the URL of your Looker instance, typically in the format `https://yourcompany.looker.com`.
*   **Looker API Client ID:** Your API Client ID obtained from your Looker instance.
*   **Looker API Client Secret:** Your API Client Secret obtained from your Looker instance.

**Authentication:**

The agent primarily uses Looker's API token-based authentication. You provide your Client ID and Client Secret, which the agent then uses to obtain an access token from Looker. This token is used for all subsequent API requests.

**Example Python Initialization:**

Here's how you would typically initialize the `LookerAgent` in your Python code. Note that `LookerAgent` is a conceptual class name used for illustration.

```python
from langchain_looker import LookerAgent # Conceptual import

# Configuration variables
LOOKER_BASE_URL = "https://yourcompany.looker.com"  # Replace with your Looker instance URL
LOOKER_CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_LOOKER_API_CLIENT_ID"    # Replace with your Client ID
LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET = "YOUR_LOOKER_API_CLIENT_SECRET" # Replace with your Client Secret

# Initialize the LookerAgent
agent = LookerAgent(
    base_url=LOOKER_BASE_URL,
    client_id=LOOKER_CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret=LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET,
    # You might specify other parameters here depending on the agent's capabilities,
    # e.g., the querying method (Direct Semantic Layer or SQL Agent)
    # query_type="semantic" # or "sql"
)

# You can now use the agent to interact with Looker
# Example:
# response = agent.query("Show me total sales last quarter")
# print(response)
```

**Important Security Note:**

It is strongly recommended not to hardcode your API credentials directly in your source code, especially if you plan to share or version control it. Instead, use environment variables, a configuration file, or a secrets management system to store and access your credentials securely.

For example, using environment variables:

```python
import os
from langchain_looker import LookerAgent # Conceptual import

# Load credentials from environment variables
LOOKER_BASE_URL = os.environ.get("LOOKER_API_BASE_URL")
LOOKER_CLIENT_ID = os.environ.get("LOOKER_API_CLIENT_ID")
LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET = os.environ.get("LOOKER_API_CLIENT_SECRET")

if not all([LOOKER_BASE_URL, LOOKER_CLIENT_ID, LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET]):
    raise ValueError("Looker API credentials and base URL must be set as environment variables.")

# Initialize the LookerAgent
agent = LookerAgent(
    base_url=LOOKER_BASE_URL,
    client_id=LOOKER_CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret=LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET,
)
```
Make sure to set `LOOKER_API_BASE_URL`, `LOOKER_API_CLIENT_ID`, and `LOOKER_API_CLIENT_SECRET` in your environment before running the script.

# Direct Semantic Model Querying

One of the primary ways to interact with Looker using `langchain-looker-agent` is by directly querying its semantic model. This allows you to leverage the curated dimensions and measures defined in your Looker Explores, asking questions in natural language and getting structured data back.

**Concept:**

Instead of writing LookML or navigating Looker dashboards, you can simply ask the agent questions like "What were our total sales in Q1?" or "Show me the top 5 customers by revenue last year." The agent translates these natural language queries into API calls that target Looker's semantic layer (Explores).

**Specifying the Explore or Model:**

To ensure your queries are run against the correct data, you often need to specify the Looker Explore you intend to query. This can typically be done during agent initialization or on a per-query basis, depending on the agent's implementation. The Explore provides the context (available dimensions, measures, and joins) for your natural language query.

**Example Python Code:**

Assuming you have already configured and initialized the `LookerAgent` as shown in the "Configuration and Authentication" section, here's how you might use it for direct semantic model querying. (Actual method names and parameters may vary based on the specific library implementation).

```python
# (Agent initialization code from previous section - LOOKER_BASE_URL, LOOKER_CLIENT_ID, LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET)
# For example:
# import os
# from langchain_looker import LookerAgent # Conceptual import
#
# LOOKER_BASE_URL = os.environ.get("LOOKER_API_BASE_URL")
# LOOKER_CLIENT_ID = os.environ.get("LOOKER_API_CLIENT_ID")
# LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET = os.environ.get("LOOKER_API_CLIENT_SECRET")
#
# if not all([LOOKER_BASE_URL, LOOKER_CLIENT_ID, LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET]):
#     raise ValueError("Looker API credentials and base URL must be set as environment variables.")
#
# agent = LookerAgent(
#     base_url=LOOKER_BASE_URL,
#     client_id=LOOKER_CLIENT_ID,
#     client_secret=LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET,
#     query_type="semantic" # Explicitly set or default to semantic querying
# )

# Let's assume your Looker instance has an Explore named 'order_items' within a model 'ecommerce'
# These would typically be known by your team or discoverable via Looker's UI/API.
LOOKER_MODEL_NAME = "your_looker_model_name"  # Replace with your actual model name
LOOKER_EXPLORE_NAME = "your_looker_explore_name" # Replace with your actual explore name

# Query using natural language
try:
    # The method to specify model/explore might vary based on the agent's design.
    # It could be part of the query() method, a separate setter, or set during initialization.
    # This is a conceptual example and might need adjustment based on the actual library.

    question1 = "What were the total sales last quarter?"
    print(f"\nQuerying Looker: '{question1}' using model '{LOOKER_MODEL_NAME}' and explore '{LOOKER_EXPLORE_NAME}'")

    # Assuming the agent has a method like `run` or `query` that can take model/explore context
    response1 = agent.run( # Or agent.query(), agent.invoke() etc.
        query=question1,
        # Parameters like these might be how you specify the context
        model=LOOKER_MODEL_NAME,
        explore=LOOKER_EXPLORE_NAME
    )

    print("Response from Looker:")
    # The format of the response will depend on the agent's implementation.
    # It could be a string, a Pandas DataFrame, a list of dictionaries, etc.
    print(response1)

    question2 = "Show me the top 5 products by sales amount in the last month."
    print(f"\nQuerying Looker: '{question2}' using model '{LOOKER_MODEL_NAME}' and explore '{LOOKER_EXPLORE_NAME}'")

    response2 = agent.run( # Or agent.query(), agent.invoke() etc.
        query=question2,
        model=LOOKER_MODEL_NAME,
        explore=LOOKER_EXPLORE_NAME
    )
    print("Response from Looker:")
    print(response2)

except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}. This might indicate the agent object is not correctly initialized or the method name is different.")
    print("Please ensure your `agent` is an initialized instance of `LookerAgent` (or the correct class name) and check the method for querying.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

```

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Clarity of Queries:** The more specific and clear your natural language query, the better the agent will be able to translate it into the correct Looker query. Vague questions might lead to unexpected or incorrect results.
*   **Understanding Your Data Model:** While you don't need to write LookML, having a basic understanding of the dimensions (e.g., `order_date`, `customer_name`, `product_category`) and measures (e.g., `total_sales`, `average_order_value`, `count_of_users`) available in your chosen Explore will help you formulate effective questions.
*   **Agent Capabilities and Parameters:** The exact syntax for specifying models/Explores (e.g., as parameters to the query method, during agent initialization) and the format of the returned data (e.g., text, JSON, Pandas DataFrame) will depend on the specific implementation of `langchain-looker-agent`. Always refer to the agent's official documentation or source code for precise usage.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to manage cases where queries might be ambiguous, data is not found, or there are issues communicating with the Looker API.

# Using the SQL Agent

For users who prefer or require more direct control over the data querying process, or for scenarios where natural language to SQL translation is desired, `langchain-looker-agent` may provide a SQL Agent. This component typically allows for generating and/or executing SQL queries against your Looker-connected database.

**Purpose and Functionality:**

The SQL Agent serves a few potential purposes:

1.  **Natural Language to SQL:** It can translate natural language questions (e.g., "Show me all users from California who signed up last month") into executable SQL queries. This is useful for users who don't want to write SQL but need its expressive power.
2.  **Direct SQL Execution:** It might allow you to provide a raw SQL query directly, which the agent then executes against the appropriate database connection configured in Looker.
3.  **SQL to Semantic Layer (Less Common for "SQL Agent"):** While typically "Direct Semantic Model Querying" handles semantic interaction, some advanced SQL agents might attempt to map SQL query constructs back to Looker model elements. This is a more complex scenario.

The primary benefit is flexibility, allowing users to bypass the curated semantic layer if needed or to leverage existing SQL knowledge.

**Example Python Code for SQL Agent:**

The initialization and usage would be similar to the main agent, potentially with a specific parameter to enable SQL mode or by using a dedicated SQL agent class if provided by the library. (Actual class names and parameters will depend on the library's design).

```python
# (Agent initialization code from "Configuration and Authentication" - LOOKER_BASE_URL, LOOKER_CLIENT_ID, LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET)
# For example:
# import os
# from langchain_looker import LookerAgent, LookerSQLAgent # Conceptual: actual class names might differ
#
# LOOKER_BASE_URL = os.environ.get("LOOKER_API_BASE_URL")
# LOOKER_CLIENT_ID = os.environ.get("LOOKER_API_CLIENT_ID")
# LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET = os.environ.get("LOOKER_API_CLIENT_SECRET")
#
# if not all([LOOKER_BASE_URL, LOOKER_CLIENT_ID, LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET]):
#     raise ValueError("Looker API credentials and base URL must be set as environment variables.")

# Option 1: Initializing the main agent with SQL mode (conceptual)
# sql_agent = LookerAgent(
#     base_url=LOOKER_BASE_URL,
#     client_id=LOOKER_CLIENT_ID,
#     client_secret=LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET,
#     query_type="sql" # Specify SQL agent type
# )

# Option 2: Using a dedicated LookerSQLAgent class (conceptual)
# sql_agent = LookerSQLAgent(
#     base_url=LOOKER_BASE_URL,
#     client_id=LOOKER_CLIENT_ID,
#     client_secret=LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET,
#     # You might need to specify the Looker connection name if your instance has multiple DB connections
#     # connection_name="your_looker_database_connection_name"
# )

# For this example, we use `sql_agent` as a placeholder for a correctly initialized agent
# capable of SQL operations. The actual class and initialization will depend on the library.

# Mock agent for demonstration if actual library is not available:
class MockLookerSQLAgent:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        print(f"MockLookerSQLAgent initialized with: {kwargs}")
        self.connection_name = kwargs.get("connection_name", "default_connection")

    def get_sql(self, natural_language_query: str, **kwargs) -> str:
        print(f"Translating to SQL: '{natural_language_query}' for connection '{self.connection_name}' with context {kwargs}")
        # Placeholder SQL generation
        return f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE location = 'California' AND signup_date >= '2023-01-01'; -- NL Query: {natural_language_query}"

    def execute_sql(self, sql_query: str, **kwargs) -> list[dict]:
        print(f"Executing SQL: '{sql_query}' on connection '{self.connection_name}' with context {kwargs}")
        # Placeholder result
        return [{"user_id": 1, "name": "John Doe", "location": "California", "signup_date": "2023-01-15"}]

    def query(self, natural_language_query: str = None, sql_query: str = None, **kwargs) -> any:
        if natural_language_query and sql_query:
            raise ValueError("Provide either natural_language_query OR sql_query, not both.")
        if natural_language_query:
            generated_sql = self.get_sql(natural_language_query, **kwargs)
            # Agent might directly execute or just return SQL based on its design
            return self.execute_sql(generated_sql, **kwargs)
        elif sql_query:
            return self.execute_sql(sql_query, **kwargs)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Either natural_language_query or sql_query must be provided.")

# Replace with actual agent initialization from the `langchain-looker-agent` library
sql_agent = MockLookerSQLAgent( # This is the MOCK agent
     base_url="YOUR_LOOKER_BASE_URL_FROM_ENV_OR_CONFIG",
     client_id="YOUR_LOOKER_CLIENT_ID_FROM_ENV_OR_CONFIG",
     client_secret="YOUR_LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_ENV_OR_CONFIG",
     connection_name="your_database_connection_name" # Specify the Looker DB connection if needed
)

try:
    # Scenario 1: Natural Language to SQL, then execution
    nl_query = "Show me all users from New York who signed up in the last 6 months"
    print(f"\nQuerying with Natural Language: '{nl_query}'")
    results_from_nl = sql_agent.query(natural_language_query=nl_query) # Pass kwargs if agent supports model/explore context here
    print("Results from Natural Language Query:")
    for row in results_from_nl:
        print(row)

    # Scenario 2: Directly executing a SQL query
    raw_sql = "SELECT product_name, SUM(sale_price) as total_revenue FROM order_items WHERE order_date >= '2023-06-01' GROUP BY product_name ORDER BY total_revenue DESC LIMIT 5;"
    print(f"\nExecuting direct SQL: '{raw_sql}'")
    results_from_raw_sql = sql_agent.query(sql_query=raw_sql) # Pass kwargs if agent supports model/explore context here
    print("Results from Direct SQL Query:")
    for row in results_from_raw_sql:
        print(row)

    # Scenario 3: Just getting the SQL from Natural Language (if supported by the actual agent)
    nl_query_for_sql = "What is the average order value by month?"
    # This functionality depends on the specific agent's API (e.g., a dedicated get_sql method or a parameter to query/run)
    if hasattr(sql_agent, 'get_sql'): # Check if our mock (or real) agent has this
        generated_sql_only = sql_agent.get_sql(natural_language_query=nl_query_for_sql)
        print(f"\nGenerated SQL for '{nl_query_for_sql}':")
        print(generated_sql_only)
    else:
        print(f"\nNote: The current agent does not have a separate `get_sql` method. Querying executes directly.")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred with the SQL Agent: {e}")

```

**Retrieving and Interpreting Results:**

*   **From Natural Language:** If you provide a natural language query, the SQL Agent might first convert it to a SQL query. Some agents might return this generated SQL to you for inspection before execution, or they might execute it directly. The final result is typically structured data (e.g., a list of dictionaries, Pandas DataFrame) similar to what you'd get from a direct database query.
*   **From Direct SQL:** If you provide a SQL query, the results will be the direct output from the database, usually in a tabular format.
*   **Data Format:** The exact format of the returned data (e.g., JSON, list of dicts, DataFrame) depends on the `langchain-looker-agent` implementation.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Database Connection:** Ensure the Looker API user credentials used by the agent have access to the necessary database connections within Looker and permissions to run queries against them. You might need to specify which Looker database connection the SQL agent should target if your Looker instance is connected to multiple databases.
*   **SQL Dialect:** The SQL dialect will be that of the underlying database connected to Looker (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, PostgreSQL). Write your SQL accordingly if providing direct SQL.
*   **Security:** Executing raw SQL, especially if constructed from user input, carries security risks (e.g., SQL injection). If the agent generates SQL from natural language, it should ideally use parameterized queries or other sanitization methods. If you are writing direct SQL, ensure it's safe and does not expose sensitive operations.
*   **Complexity vs. Semantic Layer:** While the SQL Agent offers power and flexibility, it bypasses the curated business logic and user-friendly naming of Looker's semantic layer. For many analytical tasks, querying the semantic model directly is often safer, easier to maintain, and more aligned with business definitions. Use the SQL Agent when you have specific needs that the semantic layer cannot address or when you are comfortable working directly with SQL.

# Best Practices, Limitations, and Troubleshooting

To make the most of `langchain-looker-agent` and to handle common issues, consider the following best practices, limitations, and troubleshooting tips.

**Tips for Effective Querying:**

1.  **Be Specific with Natural Language (Direct Semantic Model):**
    *   When querying the semantic model, phrase your questions clearly and unambiguously.
    *   Instead of "Show me sales," try "What were the total net sales for the apparel category in the last completed quarter?"
    *   Mention specific dimensions, measures, and timeframes if applicable.

2.  **Understand Your Looker Model (Direct Semantic Model):**
    *   Familiarize yourself with the available Explores, dimensions, and measures in your Looker instance.
    *   Knowing what data is available and how it's structured will help you ask relevant and effective questions.
    *   Refer to your Looker instance or its documentation for model details.

3.  **Context for SQL Agent (Natural Language to SQL):**
    *   If using the SQL Agent to translate natural language to SQL, provide enough context for the agent to understand which tables and fields are relevant.
    *   For example, instead of "Find customer orders," try "Find orders for customer ID 123 from the 'orders' table."
    *   Mentioning specific table or column names can significantly improve accuracy if the agent is designed to use such hints.

4.  **Know Your Schema (SQL Agent - Direct SQL):**
    *   When writing direct SQL queries for the SQL Agent, ensure you know the correct table names, column names, and SQL dialect for the target database connection in Looker.
    *   Incorrect identifiers or syntax will lead to database errors.

5.  **Iterate and Refine:**
    *   If your initial query doesn't yield the expected results, try rephrasing it, adding more detail, or breaking it into simpler parts.
    *   Natural language understanding can sometimes require a few attempts to get right.

**Limitations:**

It's important to understand the potential limitations of `langchain-looker-agent`, as these can vary based on its specific implementation:

1.  **Query Complexity:**
    *   **Natural Language Agent (Semantic):** May struggle with highly complex analytical questions that involve multiple layers of aggregation, deeply nested logic, or abstract concepts not easily mapped to the existing Looker semantic model. For instance, asking for "the multi-year growth rate of the 3-month moving average of sales for products whose names contain 'X', compared to the previous period's same growth rate" might be too complex for direct translation.
    *   **SQL Agent (NL-to-SQL):** The complexity of SQL it can generate from natural language will vary. It might not support advanced SQL features like complex window functions (e.g., `LAG() OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)` combined with other calculations), common table expressions (CTEs) with intricate recursion, or very specific database-dialect functions unless explicitly trained or programmed for them.
    *   **SQL Agent (Direct SQL):** While you can write complex SQL, the agent itself isn't adding intelligence here, merely executing it. The limitations are then those of the underlying database and Looker's ability to run raw SQL queries, including execution timeouts or resource limits.

2.  **Reliance on Pre-defined Semantic Layer:**
    *   The natural language agent primarily leverages dimensions and measures already defined in your Looker model by your LookML developers.
    *   It **cannot typically invent new complex calculations or business metrics on the fly** if they aren't based on existing measures or straightforward aggregations of available dimensions/measures. For example, if you don't have a "Customer Lifetime Value" measure or "Churn Rate" pre-defined in Looker with all its associated logic, the agent likely can't derive these from a simple natural language query without explicit, multi-step prompting or if the underlying Looker model isn't rich enough to support such a calculation through existing fields. It won't create a detailed cohort analysis from scratch unless such patterns are within its capabilities and the necessary fields are available and understood.

3.  **Ambiguity in Natural Language:**
    *   Natural language can be inherently ambiguous. The agent might misinterpret queries if they are not phrased precisely or if they use colloquialisms or domain-specific jargon not understood by the agent, leading to unexpected or incorrect results.

4.  **Knowledge Cut-off (for LLM-backed agents):**
    *   If the agent uses a Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language understanding, its knowledge about your specific Looker model's metadata (new Explores, dimensions, measures) is only as current as its last update or the information provided to it during initialization/querying. It might not be aware of real-time changes to the Looker model unless designed to fetch this dynamically or be re-initialized.

5.  **Data Volume and Performance:**
    *   Extremely large result sets or very complex queries can lead to performance issues or timeouts. These are often governed by Looker instance settings, database limits, or API quotas, not just the agent itself.

**Common Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Verify API Credentials and Permissions:**
    *   **Issue:** Authentication errors (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden).
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Double-check that your Looker API Client ID and Client Secret are correct and have no leading/trailing whitespace.
        *   Ensure these credentials are for a user account that has the necessary permissions in Looker to:
            *   Access the API (standard API user permissions).
            *   Query the specific Models, Explores, or database connections you are targeting.
            *   Run queries (relevant permissions might include `access_data`, `see_lookml`, `see_user_dashboards`, `explore`, `develop` depending on the operation).
        *   Regenerate credentials in Looker if you suspect they are compromised or incorrect.

2.  **Check Looker Instance URL (Base URL):**
    *   **Issue:** Connection errors (e.g., "Cannot connect to host," "Invalid URL," SSL errors).
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Confirm that the `base_url` provided during agent initialization is the correct HTTPS URL for your Looker instance (e.g., `https://yourcompany.looker.com`). Do not include `/api/` or other paths in the base URL.
        *   Ensure there are no typos or extra characters.
        *   Verify that your environment can reach this URL (e.g., no firewall issues, DNS resolution is correct).

3.  **Interpret Common Error Messages:**
    *   **404 Not Found:** Could mean the specific Explore, Model, or API endpoint path is incorrect or doesn't exist. Verify names and paths. The API user may also not have permission to see the specific Looker content, resulting in a 404.
    *   **400 Bad Request:** Often indicates an issue with the query itself (e.g., invalid parameters, malformed natural language query that couldn't be parsed, or incorrect SQL syntax for the SQL Agent). Review your query and the agent's requirements.
    *   **429 Too Many Requests:** You might be hitting API rate limits. Check Looker's API policies and consider adding retry logic with backoff.
    *   **500 Internal Server Error (from Looker):** This usually indicates an issue on the Looker side. Check Looker logs if possible, or wait and try again. It could be a complex query failing or a temporary Looker issue.
    *   **Timeout Errors:** The query might be too complex and is taking too long to execute. Try simplifying your query or applying more restrictive filters. Network issues or Looker instance performance can also cause timeouts.

4.  **Agent Access to Explores/Connections:**
    *   **Issue:** Agent reports it cannot find a specified Explore (for semantic queries) or errors related to database connections (for SQL Agent).
    *   **Solution:**
        *   **Semantic Queries:** Ensure the Looker Model and Explore names are spelled correctly (case-sensitivity might matter) and that the API user has permission to access that specific Explore.
        *   **SQL Agent:** If the SQL Agent requires specifying a Looker database connection, ensure the connection name is correct and the API user has privileges to use it.

5.  **Check Agent and Library Versions:**
    *   **Issue:** Unexpected behavior or errors that don't match documentation.
    *   **Solution:**
        *   Ensure you are using a compatible version of `langchain-looker-agent` and its dependencies (like `langchain` itself). Check the library's `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` for version constraints.
        *   Check the library's documentation or release notes for any breaking changes or known issues with your version.

6.  **Enable Verbose Logging/Debugging:**
    *   **Issue:** Unclear errors or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Solution:** If the agent or Langchain framework offers a verbose or debug mode (e.g., `langchain.debug = True`), enable it. This can provide more detailed logs about the steps the agent is taking, the API calls it's making, and the responses it's receiving, which can be invaluable for pinpointing the problem.

7.  **Consult Documentation and Community:**
    *   Always refer to the official documentation for `langchain-looker-agent` (if available) and Langchain itself for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
    *   Look for community forums (e.g., Langchain Discord, Stack Overflow) or GitHub issues for the library where you might find solutions to similar problems or report new ones.

Happy Querying!
